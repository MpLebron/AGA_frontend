                <label>Description</label>: Global Environmental Change is a peer-reviewed international journal publishing high
                quality, theoretically and empirically rigorous articles, which advance knowledge about the human and policy dimensions of
                global environmental change. The journal interprets global environmental change to mean the outcome of processes that are manifest
                in localities, but with consequences at multiple spatial, temporal and socio-political scales. The journal is interested in articles which
                have a significant social science component. <br>

                <label>Description</label>: The primary aim of Dialogues in Human Geography
                is to stimulate open and critical debate on the philosophical, methodological and pedagogic
                foundations of geographic thought and praxis. It publishes articles, with responses, which seek
                to critique present thinking and praxis and set the agenda for future avenues of geographic thought,
                empirical research and pedagogy. Dialogues is theoretical in orientation, forward looking, and seeks to
                publish original and innovative work that pushes the boundaries of geographical theory,
                praxis and pedagogy through a unique (in Geography) and innovative format of open peer commentary.<br>

                in multiple ways and invite actions resulting in landscape change.

                <label>Description</label>: Remote sensing is a technology that engages electromagnetic sensors to measure and monitor changes in the earth’s surface and atmosphere. Normally this is accomplished through the use of a satellite or aircraft. Remote Sensing, in its third edition, seamlessly connects the art and science of earth remote sensing with the latest interpretative tools and techniques of computer-aided image processing. Newly expanded and updated, this edition delivers more of the applied scientific theory and practical results that helped the previous editions earn wide acclaim and become classroom and industry standards.

Papers should relate to the theory, concepts and techniques of science and engineering as applied to sensing the earth, oceans, atmosphere, and space, and the processing, interpretation, and dissemination of this information. The technical content of papers must be both new and significant. Experimental data must be complete and include sufficient description of experimental apparatus, methods, and relevant experimental conditions. GRSL encourages the incorporation of "extended objects" or "multimedia" such as animations to enhance the shorter papers.

These problems may be related to the assessment, management and allocation of the world's physical and/or human resources. The underlying rationale of the journal is that only through a clear understanding of the relevant societal, physical, and coupled natural-humans systems can we resolve such problems.

                <label>Description</label>: Geographical Analysis publishes geographical theory, model building, and quantitative methods to geographers and scholars in a wide spectrum of related fields.
                First in its specialty area and one of the most frequently cited journals in geography,
                Geographical Analysis has, since 1969, published significant advances in geographical theory,
                model building, and quantitative methods to geographers and scholars in a wide spectrum of related fields.
                Traditionally, mathematical and nonmathematical articulations of geographical theory, and statements and discussions of
                the analytic paradigm are published in the journal. Spatial data analyses and spatial econometrics and statistics are strongly represented.
